The implementations are easy since only the core part of the search algorithm is needed. All other parts of NAS (e.g. data structures for storing neural architectures, training of the neural networks) are done by the Auto-Keras framework. Why implement NAS papers in Auto-Keras? The NAS papers usually evaluate their work with the same dataset (e.g. CIFAR10), but they are not directly comparable because of the data preparation and training process are different, the influence of which are significant enough to change the rankings of these NAS methods. We have implemented some of the NAS methods in the framework. More state-of-the-art methods are in progress. There are three advantages of implementing the NAS methods in Auto-Keras. First, it fairly compares the NAS methods independent from other factors (e.g. the choice of optimizer, data augmentation). Second, researchers can easily change the experiment datasets used for NAS. Many of the currently available NAS implementations couple too much with the dataset used, which makes it hard to replace the original dataset with a new one. Third, it saves the effort of finding and running code from different sources. Different code may have different requirements of dependencies and environments, which may conflict with each other. Baseline methods implemented We have implemented four NAS baseline methods: random search : we explore the search space via morphing the network architectures randomly, so the actual performance of the generated neural architecture has no effect on later search. grid search : we manually specified subset of the hyperparameter space to search, i.e., the number of layers and the width of the layers are predefined. greed search : we explore the search space in a greedy way. The \"greedy\" here means the base architecture for the next iteration of search is chosen from those generated by current iteration, the one that have best performance on the training/validation set in our implementation. bayesian optimization : it's the default search strategy of Auto-Keras currently. refer arXiv:1806.10282 for more detail. How to run the baseline methods? Refer to examples/nas/cifar10_tutorial.py for more details. How to implement your own search? To implement your own NAS searcher, you need to implement your own searcher class YOUR_SEARCHER, which is derived from base Searcher class. For your YOUR_SEARCHER class, you must provide implementation of the two abstract method: generate(self, multiprocessing_queue) , which is invoked to generate the next neural architecture. The return value of the generate function should be two elements. The first one is the generated graph. The second one is any other information you want to pass to the update function. If you have multiple values to pass, you need to put them into one tuple. If you don't have any value to pass, you can just put None. update(self, other_info, model_id, graph, metric_value) , which is invoked to update the controller with evaluation result of a neural architecture. The graph and other_info in the parameters are the corresponding return value of the generate function. There is no required return value for this function. You can refer to the default BayesianSearcher as an example. The generate function returns the generated graph and the father ID of the graph in the search tree. Then when the generated model finish training, the father ID ( other_info ) and ID ( model_id ) and instance ( graph ) and metric value ( metric_value ) of the model are passed to update function to update the controller BayesianOptimizer . You can find more example here . You are welcome to implement your own method for NAS in our framework.

Note: currently, Auto-Keras is only compatible with: Python 3.6 . Latest Stable Version ( pip installation): You can run the following pip installation command in your terminal to install the latest stable version. pip install autokeras Bleeding Edge Version (manual installation): If you want to install the latest development version. You need to download the code from the GitHub repo and run the following commands in the project directory. pip install -r requirements.txt python setup.py install A Simple Example We show an example of image classification on the MNIST dataset, which is a famous benchmark image dataset for hand-written digits classification. Auto-Keras supports different types of data inputs. Data with numpy array (.npy) format. [source] If the images and the labels are already formatted into numpy arrays, you can from keras.datasets import mnist from autokeras.image.image_supervised import ImageClassifier if __name__ == '__main__': (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data() x_train = x_train.reshape(x_train.shape + (1,)) x_test = x_test.reshape(x_test.shape + (1,)) clf = ImageClassifier(verbose=True) clf.fit(x_train, y_train, time_limit=12 * 60 * 60) clf.final_fit(x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, retrain=True) y = clf.evaluate(x_test, y_test) print(y) In the example above, the images and the labels are already formatted into numpy arrays. What if your data are raw image files ( e.g. .jpg, .png, .bmp)? [source] You can use our load_image_dataset function to load the images and their labels as follows. from autokeras.image.image_supervised import load_image_dataset x_train, y_train = load_image_dataset(csv_file_path=\"train/label.csv\", images_path=\"train\") print(x_train.shape) print(y_train.shape) x_test, y_test = load_image_dataset(csv_file_path=\"test/label.csv\", images_path=\"test\") print(x_test.shape) print(y_test.shape) The argument csv_file_path is the path to the CSV file containing the image file names and their corresponding labels. Both csv files and the raw image datasets could be downloaded from link . Here is an example of the csv file. File Name,Label 00000.jpg,5 00001.jpg,0 00002.jpg,4 00003.jpg,1 00004.jpg,9 00005.jpg,2 00006.jpg,1 ... The second argument images_path is the path to the directory containing all the images with those file names listed in the CSV file. The returned values x_train and y_train are the numpy arrays, which can be directly feed into the fit function of ImageClassifier . This CSV file for train or test can be created from folders containing images of a specific class (meaning label): train \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500class_1 \u2502 \u2502 class_1_image_1.png \u2502 \u2502 class_1_image_2.png | | ... \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500class_2 \u2502 class_2_image_1.png \u2502 class_2_image_2.png | ... The code below shows an example of how to create the CSV: train_dir = 'train' # Path to the train directory class_dirs = [i for i in os.listdir(path=train_dir) if os.path.isdir(os.path.join(train_dir, i))] with open('train/label.csv', 'w') as train_csv: fieldnames = ['File Name', 'Label'] writer = csv.DictWriter(train_csv, fieldnames=fieldnames) writer.writeheader() label = 0 for current_class in class_dirs: for image in os.listdir(os.path.join(train_dir, current_class)): writer.writerow({'File Name': str(image), 'Label':label}) label += 1 train_csv.close() Enable Multi-GPU Training Auto-Keras support multiple GPU training in the default setting. There's no additional step needed to enable multiple GPU training. However, if multiple-GPU training is not a desirable behavior. You can disable it via environmental variable. CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES . For example, in your bash: export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 . Keep in mind that when using multiple-GPU, make sure batch size is big enough that multiple-gpu context switch overhead won't effect the performance too much. Otherwise multiple-gpu training may be slower than single-GPU training. Portable Models How to export Portable model? [source] from autokeras import ImageClassifier clf = ImageClassifier(verbose=True, augment=False) clf.export_autokeras_model(model_file_name) The model will be stored into the path model_file_name . How to load exported Portable model? [source] from autokeras.utils import pickle_from_file model = pickle_from_file(model_file_name) results = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test) print(results) The model will be loaded from the path model_file_name and then you can use the functions listed in PortableImageSupervised . Model Visualizations How to visualize the best selected architecture? [source] While trying to create a model, let's say an Image classifier on MNIST, there is a facility for the user to visualize a .PDF depiction of the best architecture that was chosen by autokeras, after model training is complete. Prerequisites : 1) graphviz must be installed in your system. Refer Installation Guide 2) Additionally, also install \"graphviz\" python package using pip / conda pip: pip install graphviz conda : conda install -c conda-forge python-graphviz If the above installations are complete, proceed with the following steps : Step 1 : Specify a path before starting your model training clf = ImageClassifier(path=\"~/automodels/\",verbose=True, augment=False) # Give a custom path of your choice clf.fit(x_train, y_train, time_limit=30 * 60) clf.final_fit(x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, retrain=True) Step 2 : After the model training is complete, run examples/visualize.py , whilst passing the same path as parameter if __name__ == '__main__': visualize('~/automodels/') Net Modules MlpModule tutorial. [source] MlpGenerator in net_module.py is a child class of Networkmodule . It can generates neural architecture with MLP modules Normally, there's two place to call the MlpGenerator, one is call MlpGenerator.fit while the other is MlpGenerator.final_fit . For example, in a image classification class ImageClassifier , one can initialize the cnn module as: mlpModule = MlpModule(loss, metric, searcher_args, path, verbose) Where: * loss and metric determines by the type of training model(classification or regression or others) * search_args can be referred in search.py * path is the path to store the whole searching process and generated model. * verbose is a boolean. Setting it to true prints to stdout. Then, for the searching part, one can call: mlpModule.fit(n_output_node, input_shape, train_data, test_data, time_limit=24 * 60 * 60) where: * n_output_node: A integer value represent the number of output node in the final layer. * input_shape: A tuple to express the shape of every train entry. For example, MNIST dataset would be (28,28,1). * train_data: A PyTorch DataLoader instance representing the training data. * test_data: A PyTorch DataLoader instance representing the testing data. * time_limit: A integer value represents the time limit on searching for models. And for final testing(testing the best searched model), one can call: mlpModule.final_fit(train_data, test_data, trainer_args=None, retrain=False) where: * train_data: A DataLoader instance representing the training data. * test_data: A DataLoader instance representing the testing data. * trainer_args: A dictionary containing the parameters of the ModelTrainer constructor. * retrain: A boolean of whether reinitialize the weights of the model. CnnModule tutorial. [source] CnnGenerator in net_module.py is a child class of Networkmodule . It can generates neural architecture with basic cnn modules and the ResNet module. Normally, there's two place to call the CnnGenerator, one is call CnnGenerator.fit while the other is CnnGenerator.final_fit . For example, in a image classification class ImageClassifier , one can initialize the cnn module as: from autokeras import CnnModule from autokeras.nn.loss_function import classification_loss from autokeras.nn.metric import Accuracy TEST_FOLDER = \"test\" cnnModule = CnnModule(loss=classification_loss, metric=Accuracy, searcher_args={}, path=TEST_FOLDER, verbose=False) Where: * loss and metric determines by the type of training model(classification or regression or others) * search_args can be referred in search.py * path is the path to store the whole searching process and generated model. * verbose is a boolean. Setting it to true prints to stdout. Then, for the searching part, one can call: cnnModule.fit(n_output_node, input_shape, train_data, test_data, time_limit=24 * 60 * 60) where: * n_output_node: A integer value represent the number of output node in the final layer. * input_shape: A tuple to express the shape of every train entry. For example, MNIST dataset would be (28,28,1). * train_data: A PyTorch DataLoader instance representing the training data. * test_data: A PyTorch DataLoader instance representing the testing data. * time_limit: A integer value represents the time limit on searching for models. And for final testing(testing the best searched model), one can call: cnnModule.final_fit(train_data, test_data, trainer_args=None, retrain=False) where: * train_data: A DataLoader instance representing the training data. * test_data: A DataLoader instance representing the testing data. * trainer_args: A dictionary containing the parameters of the ModelTrainer constructor. * retrain: A boolean of whether reinitialize the weights of the model. Task Modules Automated text classifier tutorial. [source] Class TextClassifier and TextRegressor are designed for automated generate best performance cnn neural architecture for a given text dataset. clf = TextClassifier(verbose=True) clf.fit(x=x_train, y=y_train, time_limit=12 * 60 * 60) x_train: string format text data y_train: int format text label After searching the best model, one can call clf.final_fit to test the best model found in searching. Notes: Preprocessing of the text data: * Class TextClassifier and TextRegressor contains a pre-process of the text data. Which means the input data should be in string format. * The default pre-process model uses the glove6B model from Stanford NLP. * To change the default setting of the pre-process model, one need to change the corresponding variable: EMBEDDING_DIM , PRE_TRAIN_FILE_LINK , PRE_TRAIN_FILE_LINK , PRE_TRAIN_FILE_NAME in constant.py . Pretrained Models Object detection tutorial. [source] by Wuyang Chen from Dr. Atlas Wang's group at CSE Department, Texas A&M. class_id_mapping = {0 : \"Business\", 1 : \"Sci/Tech\", 2 : \"Sports\", 3 : \"World\"} ObjectDetector in object_detector.py is a child class of Pretrained . Currently it can load a pretrained SSD model ( Liu, Wei, et al. \"Ssd: Single shot multibox detector.\" European conference on computer vision. Springer, Cham, 2016. ) and find object(s) in a given image. Let's first import the ObjectDetector and create a detection model ( detector ) with from autokeras.pretrained.object_detector import ObjectDetector detector = ObjectDetector() It will automatically download and load the weights into detector . Note: the ObjectDetector class can automatically detect the existance of available cuda device(s), and use the device if exists. Finally you can make predictions against an image: results = detector.predict(\"/path/to/images/000001.jpg\", output_file_path=\"/path/to/images/\") Function detector.predict() requires the path to the image. If the output_file_path is not given, the detector will just return the numerical results as a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary is like {\"left\": int, \"top\": int, \"width\": int, \"height\": int: \"category\": str, \"confidence\": float}, where left and top is the (left, top) coordinates of the bounding box of the object and width and height are width and height of the box. category is a string representing the class the object belongs to, and the confidence can be regarded as the probability that the model believes its prediction is correct. If the output_file_path is given, then the results mentioned above will be plotted and saved in a new image file with suffix \"_prediction\" into the given output_file_path . If you run the example/object_detection/object_detection_example.py, you will get result [{'category': 'person', 'width': 331, 'height': 500, 'left': 17, 'confidence': 0.9741123914718628, 'top': 0}] Sentiment Analysis tutorial. [source] The sentiment analysis module provides an interface to find the sentiment of any text. The pretrained model is obtained by training Google AI\u2019s BERT model on IMDb dataset . Let\u2019s import the SentimentAnalysis module from text_classifier.py . It is derived from the super class TextClassifier which is the child class of Pretrained class. from autokeras.pretrained.text_classifier import SentimentAnalysis sentiment_analysis = SentimentAnalysis() During initialization of SentimentAnalysis , the pretrained model is loaded into memory i.e. CPU\u2019s or GPU\u2019s, if available. Now, you may directly call the predict function in SentimentAnalysis class on any input sentence provided as a string as shown below. The function returns a value between 0 and 1. polarity = sentiment_cls.predict(\"The model is working well..\") Note: If the output value of the predict function is close to 0, it implies the statement has negative sentiment, whereas value close to 1 implies positive sentiment. If you run sentiment_analysis_example.py , you should get an output value of 0.9 which implies that the input statement The model is working well.. has strong positive sentiment. Topic Classification tutorial. [source] The topic classifier module provides an interface to find the topic of any text. The pretrained model is obtained by training Google AI\u2019s BERT model on AGNews dataset . Let\u2019s import the TopicClassifier module from text_classifier.py . It is derived from the super class TextClassifier which is the child class of Pretrained class. from autokeras.pretrained.text_classifier import TopicClassifier topic_classifier = TopicClassifier() During initialization of TopicClassifier , the pretrained model is loaded into memory i.e. CPU\u2019s or GPU\u2019s, if available. Now, you may directly call the predict function in TopicClassifier class on any input sentence provided as a string as shown below. The function returns one of the fours topics Business , Sci/Tech , World and Sports . class_name = topic_classifier.predict(\"With some more practice, they will definitely make it to finals..\") If you run topic_classifier_example.py , you should see the predict function returns the label Sports , which is the predicted label for the input statement. Voice generator tutorial. [source] The voice generator is a refactor of deepvoice3 .

Pull Request Guide Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines: Fork the repository. Create a new branch from the master branch. Give your new branch a meaningful name. Pull request from your new branch to the master branch of the original autokeras repo. Give your pull request a meaningful name. Include \"resolves #issue_number\" in the description of the pull request and briefly describe your contribution. Submit the pull request from the first day of your development (after your first commit) and prefix the title of the pull request with [WIP] . When the contribution is complete, make sure the pull request passed the CI tests. Change the [WIP] to [MRG] . Set the reviewer to @jhfjhfj1 . For the case of bug fixes, add new test cases which would fail before your bug fix. If you are a collaborator of the autokeras repo, you don't need to fork the repository. Just create a new branch directly. You also need to change the assignee to the reviewer when request for code review. The reviewer will change the assignee back to you when finished the review. The assignee always means who should push the progress of the pull request now. Code Style Guide This project tries to closely follow the official Python Style Guide detailed in PEP8 . The docstrings follow the Google Python Style Guide . Please follow these style guide closely, especially for the docstrings, which would be extracted automatically to generate the documentation. Documentation Guide: The documentation should be provided in two ways, docstring, tutorial, and readme file. We prefer the documentation to be as complete as possible. Docstring All the methods and classes may directly be called by the user need to be documented with docstrings. The docstrings should contain all the fields required by the Google Python Style Guide . Tutorial You only need to add tutorials to your code if you are contributing or updating a new task module, e.g. TextClassifier, VideoClassifier, or a new function could be directly called by the user. You can modify mkdocs/docs/start.md to add your tutorial. The code example of your new task module should be added to the examples directory. Readme File You only need to add tutorials to your code if you are contributing or updating a new task module, e.g. TextClassifier, VideoClassifier. The readme file should be named as README.md . It should be written in Markdown. The content should contain your name, affiliation, and any reference to the method you use. Testing Guide Pytest is used to write the unit tests of Auto-Keras. You should test your code by writing unit testing code in tests directory. The testing file name should be the .py file with a prefix of test_ in the corresponding directory, e.g., the name should be test_layers.py if the code of which is to test layer.py . The tests should be run in the root directory of the project by executing the cov.sh file. It would output the coverage information into a directory named htmlcov . Please make sure the code coverage percentage does not decrease after your contribution, otherwise, the code will not be merged. Developer Tools Guide We highly recommend you to use Pycharm and virtualenvwrapper . Pycharm Pycharm is the best IDE for large project development in Python. We recommend you inspect the code before you pull request to fix any error and warning suggested by the inspection. Virtualenvwrapper Virtualenvwrapper is a tool to build separated Python environment for each project. In this way, you can install a different version of Tensorflow, Pytorch, or any other package for each project. We recommend you to create a virtualenv for autokeras development with virtualenvwrapper, and only install the packages required by autokeras with the corresponding version. The virtualenv should be created based on Python 3.6 interpreter. Use pycharm to select the virtualenv as interpreter . Reusable Code Guide You may checkout this code review video to get familiar with the code structure. Other than the base classes you have to extend, there are some other classes you can extend. ModelTrainer autokeras.model_trainer.ModelTrainer is a class for training Pytorch models. If needed a new metric or loss function other than the ones we have, you can add your own to loss_function.py and metric.py . You can follow its documentation and this example to use it. Make sure your loss function, metric, Pytorch model, and Dataloader are compatible with each other. Main Contributor List We really appreciate all the contributions.
